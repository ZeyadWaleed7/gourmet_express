# actions

- sprints issues were uploaded on github.
- we used templates and adjusted it for the project and used html,css and java script in the making of the front end.
- we debated about converting the backend to asp.net and c# but in the end we estimated tha the shift will be too dangerous to make as the github wasn't linked to asp.net and alot of conflicts would have happened.
